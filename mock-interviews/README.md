# Mock Interviews

## Learning Objectives

- Practice interview skills
- Gain confidence
- Refine interview skills

## Mock Interviews

During this module, fellows will participate in two or more 30 minute mock interviews.

### Preparation:

- Make sure you are in a location that is conducive for an interview (quiet, good internet, ability to turn camera and microphone on)
- You have other programs closed and you are prepared to start the interview immediately

### How You Will Be Evaluated:

1. **Discussion question:** This is a question that is usually brought up in a behavioral interview and soemtimes brought up as well in a technical or combined interview. You can find a small list of Discussion Questions at this [LINK](https://github.com/joinpursuit/m6-peer-interviews/blob/main/discussion-questions.md) You should be able to answer any of these questions in around one minute.

2. **Trivia question:** Every lesson in this unit has a few trivia questions. One (or a similar one) will be chosen from the list. This is to help you practice talking about code concepts. These questions do not require you to code but do require you to talk about theory. e.g. What does isNaN() do? or Do these console blocks return the same thing? Why or why not?

```js
let x = '2'
let y = 2
console.log(x == y)
console.log(x === y)
```

3. **Code Challenge:** You will be given a code challenge which you will solve verbally lead by your interviewer. You should follow the problem-solving methodologies you have been taught. Demonstrating your problem-solving skills and ability to talk about code is essential.

### Here is the proper strategy to use when handling a code challenge:

1. **Understand the Problem**

   - Listen Carefully: Make sure you fully understand the problem statement. If something is unclear, ask for clarification.
   - Restate the Problem: Repeat the problem back to the interviewer in your own words to confirm your understanding.

1. **Clarify Constraints and Edge Cases**

   - Ask Questions: Clarify any constraints, input ranges, edge cases, and expected behavior for unusual or extreme inputs.
   - Confirm Examples: Provide or ask for example inputs and outputs to ensure you understand the requirements.

1. **Plan Your Approach**

   - Think Aloud: Verbally outline your approach and thought process. Discuss different ways to solve the problem and choose the most efficient one.
   - Break Down the Problem: Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

1. **Write Pseudocode**

   - Outline in Pseudocode: Before jumping into actual code, write pseudocode to organize your thoughts and plan the structure of your solution.
   - Explain the Pseudocode: Walk through the pseudocode, explaining each step and how it addresses the problem.

1. **Implement the Solution**

   - Write Code: Translate your pseudocode into actual code. - Write clean, readable code and explain what youâ€™re doing as you write.
   - Think About Edge Cases: Consider and address edge cases in your implementation.

1. **Test Your Code**

   - Test with Examples: Run through the provided examples and additional edge cases to verify your solution works correctly.
   - Debug if Necessary: If there are issues, debug by explaining your thought process and making corrections.

### Good Interview Example:

Here is an example of a [Good Coding Interview Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw4s4M3hFfs&t=140s).

While your interview would not be at this level, the approach is what you should study.

## Peer-to-Peer Mock Interviews

In addition to having interviews with your instructors, you will have opportunities to practice interviewing each other. This will also help you understand what it feels like to be on the other side of the interview, which should help clarify what interviewers are often looking for. You will be given information and materials to prepare for giving an interview.
